Consistency is the way I go, for my life is short to learn everything but with Consistency, I can atleast give it my all. When developing something, I go above and beyond to search for answers for question where I get stuck and I am not shy of asking others to help me in that regards whoever the person is, may he/she be older than me or younger than me."
